Hello! Welcome to the new series Let's Make An Accessible Tic-Tac-Toe game! As the name suggests we will be creating the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. You've probably already made this on your own, so in this series I'm going to take it one step further: make it *accessible*. How? Let's see.

## The plan

In this series we'll be making an accessible tic-tac-toe game from the ground up, including the basic UI, the game logic and make it accessible.

So here's the plan:

* Part 1: Create the board with HTML and CSS

* Part 2: Create the game logic with Javascript

* Part 3: Make the game keyboard accessible

* Part 4: Make the game screen reader accessible with ARIA Live Regions

Let's go!
