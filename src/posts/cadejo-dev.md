##  Introduction

When I [posted the tweet](https://twitter.com/SavvasStephnds/status/1372827437290172424) asking for followers' websites to review, Vinicio was the first to reply. So I got a bit excited to post my first review. [This is his website](https://www.cadejo.dev/). Thank you Vinicio for your submission!

Let's go!

## The good

### This website is *blazing* fast

Like, honestly. I opened the website, I blinked, and everything was in front of me. This is the power of static-site generators. You can't go wrong with Gatsby!

### Very nice graphics!

Don't know where he gets the photos from (Unsplash I assume?) but they add a nice touch to the list of blog posts.

### Great About page

I always love seeing About pages where the developer has put the time and effort to appear friendly and approachable.

Oh and I learned about [cadejos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadejo). Amazing work!

### Works amazingly without Javascript!

This caught me by surprise. It's rare to see websites where you can disable Javascript and work *exactly the same way* as it did with Javascript. Massive kudos to Vinicio.

## What could be improved

### Contrast

Some features at the bottom of the page could be changed to improve the contrast:

* The bottom navigation hover color
* The "Subscribe" button background color

WebAIM contrast checker shows a failure for all checks for the two colours:

### "Time investment"

The term "time investment" is something I haven't seen before in blogs. I've seen "5 minute read" but not this.

I feel like something more straight-forward like "5 minute read" would make more sense.

### Two navigation bars at footer

This one I found a bit weird. I don't see a reason why the bottom of the page should have 2 navigation bars that are exactly the same. This could potentially be a bit confusing.

## Conclusion

An overall great fast website that works with or without Javascript and a nice About page. Some minor issues.

Score: 8/10
